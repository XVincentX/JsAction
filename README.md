JsAction is a simple and lightweight RouteHandler for ASP.NET MVC that will generate automatic jQuery based Javascript and provide a direct way to call MVC Action Methods using a single data annotation.

You will no longer have to write custom ajax calls to retrieve data, but just use this library.

1. Mark your method with **JsActionAttribute**
